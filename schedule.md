**Topic**: Introduction to React Native  

**Homework**:  
Based on the "Add task" app. 

Add a new functionality called `Add activity`. In order to accomplish this, do the following:
- Add a new `textInput`
- Add a new `Button`
- Add a new `FlatList`
- Implement the flow among them

The previous 3 components are related to the `Activity` functionality. 

Keep in mind that the `Task` functionality CANNOT BE DELETED.

üìù Summary of Class 3
| Concept                     | Explanation                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| States            | It is a built-in object that allows components to store, manage, and react to dynamic data changes, triggering re-renders when updated.           |
| Props                       | They are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component, allowing data and event handlers to be shared between components.                     |
| Events      | They are user interactions (e.g., touches, gestures, text input) handled using built-in event props like onPress, onChangeText, and onScroll, often combined with gesture responders for a mobile-friendly experience.                             |
| UseState hook     | The useState hook is used to manage state within functional components, allowing components to store and update values dynamically, triggering re-renders when the state changes.  |

üìù Summary of Class 4
Class 04 focused on simple projects related to building calculators. These projects likely covered the fundamentals of user input, mathematical operations, and displaying results.

Key concepts would include managing state, handling user interactions (e.g., button presses), and implementing basic arithmetic functionality. The class provided hands-on experience with React Native, particularly for developing a super simple calculator app.
